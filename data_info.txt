Metadata information for "Gender and educational inequalities in disability-free life expectancy among older adults living in Italian regions"

For mortality data, this study draws on mortality rates coming from life tables based on census-linked mortality data by five-year age classes, gender, educational attainment,
and region of residence for 2011, including mortality records of the following three years (2012–2014). In Italy, these tables represents the last available data with such level of detail.
They are freely accessible and can be found with full metadata on Istat website: https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/212512

At the same level of detail, disability prevalence is computed based on data from the Italian survey “Aspects of daily living” (AVQ). The total sample includes 30738 individuals,
pooled over the three-year period 2012–2014, aged 65 years and older living in household. Disability prevalence is computed from the Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI)
question, differentiating individuals without disability from those with mild or severe disability. Robust prevalence estimates are obtained by averaging over the three-year period
2012–2014 and applying sample weights.
AVQ data is accessible, upon request, on Istat website: https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/4630 for 2012, and https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/129916
for 2013 and 2014.
